### antlr4 minified javascript

This repository only has the concatenated and uglified files of [antlr4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4).
Because of the way antlr4 javascript was made, it uses a module loader to load a lot of files, which requires a lot of HTTP requests. Sadly, the official repo doesn't provide a minified version. You can get it from here :)

### Installation
```npm install antlr4-js-min```
